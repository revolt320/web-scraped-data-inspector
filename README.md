# Data Inspectors (Streamlit)

Data Inspectors is a lightweight data inspection and profiling tool built with Streamlit, designed to quickly identify common issues in web-scraped datasets.

It helps analysts and scraping engineers explore, validate, and understand datasets before downstream processing or delivery.


It typically provides features such as:

File Upload – Supports CSV, Excel, or other formats for importing datasets.

Basic Information – Displays filename, number of rows, columns, column names, and data types.

Data Preview – Shows a scrollable or paginated view of the dataset.

Summary Statistics – Automatically computes descriptive statistics (mean, median, min/max, counts, nulls, etc.) for numerical and categorical columns.

Unique Value Analysis – Lists distinct values in a column, along with frequencies (useful for categorical exploration).

Filtering Options – Lets users apply conditions like “equals,” “contains,” “is null,” etc., to subset the data dynamically.

Group & Aggregation – Enables summarizing data by grouping columns and applying aggregate functions (sum, average, count, etc.).
